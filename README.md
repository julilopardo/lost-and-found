Hello CS50 community! I am Juliana Lopardo from Buenos Aires, Argentina, and this is my final project.

"Lost Pets Finder" it's a website were people who have lost their pet or found an animal that seems to belong to someone else, can reunite pet with owner.

First of all, users must register and log in order to load or obtain any information.

Via  LOST and FOUND forms, the user can provide all the information about the LOST or FOUND pet. All the information goes to a database and the website checks if
there is a match between the information just loaded and the data provided by other users. If there's a match between several attributes, the website shows the user
all the information available about the matching pets and the owner or keeper phone number an email adreess, so user can get in touch.

In "My Pets" all the pets lost and found by the current user are shown. The user should notify the website if the pet has been found, so all the information stored about it, is deleted from the database, and prevent future confusions.
